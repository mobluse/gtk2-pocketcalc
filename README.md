# Gtk2-PocketCalc
PocketCalc (unfinished) in C# &amp; Perl using Gtk+. When it's finished it should work like my PocketCalc
on Scratch.MIT.Edu.
It already demonstrates that it's possible to develop plattform independent C#-programs
(tested on Windows x86, Ubuntu x86, and Raspbian ARM for Raspberry Pi). Also, the Perl-program is
probably plattform independant (tested on Ubuntu x86 and Raspbian ARM). There is Mono with GTK+ for Mac OS X
and one can also install Gtk2 for Perl, but the last seems complicated.
