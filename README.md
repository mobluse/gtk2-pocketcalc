# Gtk2-PocketCalc
PocketCalc (unfinished) in C# (C-sharp) &amp; Perl using Gtk+. When it's finished it should work like my
PocketCalc project on Scratch.MIT.Edu.
It already demonstrates that it's possible to develop plattform independent C#-programs
(tested on Windows Vista x86, Ubuntu x86, and Raspbian ARM for Raspberry Pi). Also, the Perl-program is
plattform independant (tested on Windows Vista x86, Ubuntu x86 and Raspbian ARM). There is Mono with GTK# for Mac OS X
and one can install Gtk2 for Perl.

See source files for more info, e.g. pocketcalc.cs for info on how to run pocketcalc.exe. If everything is installed, just double-click pocketcalc.exe, but if it doesn't work, start it from Command/MS-DOS-prompt to see error-messages.

It was developed on a Raspberry Pi 2 and the Perl-version is the prototype for the C#-version.
